## Project Overview  
For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, andeither Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform thedata, you'll create four CSV fi les and use the CSV fi le data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, youâ€™ll upload theCSV fi le data into a Postgres database.

## Our Process
1. We used the provided starter files [contacts.xlsx](/Starter_Files/Resources/contacts.xlsx) and [crowdfunding.xlsx](/Starter_Files/Resources/crowdfunding.xlsx) to create 4 dataframes and exported the following csv files:  [category.csv](/Starter_Files/Resources/category.csv), [subcategory.csv](/Starter_Files/Resources/subcategory.csv), [campaign.csv](/Starter_Files/Resources/campaign.csv), [contacts.csv](/Starter_Files/Resources/contacts.csv). See our code in the file [ETL_Mini_Project_Group_6.ipynb](/Starter_Files/ETL_Mini_Project_Group_6.ipynb).  

2. We inspected the csv files and sketched an ERD using [QuickDBD](https://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com/):  
![crowdfunding_ETL_group_6_ERD.png](/Starter_Files/Resources/crowdfunding_ETL_group_6_ERD.png)  
Then, we created a database schema based on the ERD: [crowdfunding_db_schema.sql](/Starter_Files/Resources/crowdfunding_db_schema.sql).

3. In Postgres, we created a database called "crowdfunding_db". Next, we ran ["crowdfunding_db_schema.sql](/Starter_Files/Resources/crowdfunding_db_schema.sql) in the query tool to create the tables. Then, we imported the csv files into each table in the following order (it is important to import the files in the correct order):  
    1. [category.csv](/Starter_Files/Resources/category.csv)
    2. [subcategory.csv](/Starter_Files/Resources/subcategory.csv)
    3. [contacts.csv](/Starter_Files/Resources/contacts.csv)
    4. [campaign.csv](/Starter_Files/Resources/campaign.csv).  

4. We verified that each table displayed correctly when we ran the "SELECT *" statements.
